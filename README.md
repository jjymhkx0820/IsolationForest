# IsolationForest

This is a copy of Liu et al's R package for the paper *[Isolation Forest](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf)*.  
It was originally hosted [here](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=479).  

Disclaimer: This is in no way my research. I've hosted it here to make it easy for people to fork and install.  

Update: 
1. Add OpenMP parallel computing
2. Use roxygen2 for NAMESPACE control
3. Bump up version number to 0.27 

To install:  
```r
devtools::install_github("yanyachen/IsolationForest")
```
